# Insightly Project

Lightweight role-based project & task management platform built with ASP.NET Core MVC 3.1 and Entity Framework Core. Supports three personas (Admin, Team Member, Client) with scoped visibility, task assignment, and extensible roadmap for collaboration features.

---
## ‚ú® Core Features
- User authentication & role-based authorization (Identity + Roles: Admin, TeamMember, Client)
- Project management (CRUD, assign team members & clients)
- Task management (CRUD, multi-user assignment via junction table, status tracking)
- Dashboards per role (Admin metrics, Team Member view, Client view)
- Search (project name/description)
- Data seeding (roles + three default users)
- Clean separation of concerns via EF models & navigation properties

## üß© Planned / Roadmap Highlights
See `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` for full milestone plan:
- Real-time updates (future: add SignalR hub & notifications)
- Task comments, attachments, Kanban board, analytics, email notifications
- Improved scoping for clients & richer filters for tasks
- CI/CD pipeline & Dockerization

## üèó Architecture Overview

- **Presentation Layer:** ASP.NET Core MVC  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ Controllers and Razor Views for UI and routing

- **Identity & Roles:**  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ `ApplicationUser` extends ASP.NET Core Identity  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ Role-based access (Admin, Team Member, Client)

- **Data Access:**  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ Entity Framework Core with `ApplicationDbContext`

- **Core Entities:**  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ `Project`  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Äì One-to-many: `Project` ‚Üí `TaskItem`  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Äì Many-to-many: `Project` ‚Üî `ApplicationUser` via `ProjectUser`  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ `TaskItem`  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Äì Many-to-many: `TaskItem` ‚Üî `ApplicationUser` via `TaskItemUser`  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ Linking tables: `ProjectUser`, `TaskItemUser`

- **Migrations:**  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ Tracked in `Migrations/` directory

- **Data Seeding:**  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ Helper class: `Models/utils/DataSeeder.cs`

### Data Relationships (current)
```
ApplicationUser --(ProjectUser)--> Project --(TaskItem)--> TaskItem --(TaskItemUser)--> ApplicationUser
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Run (Local)
### Prerequisites
- .NET Core SDK 3.1 (LTS runtime for this project)
- SQL Server LocalDB (default on Windows) or adjust connection string `BusinessCon` in `appsettings.json`

### 1. Restore & Build
Open **Package Manager Console** in Visual Studio and run:
```powershell
# Restore NuGet packages
Update-Package -reinstall
# Build the solution
Build
```

### 2. Apply Migrations / Create DB
Database will be created automatically on first run if migrations are applied programmatically. For manual control via Package Manager Console:
```powershell
# Add a migration (if you introduce changes)
Add-Migration <Name>
# Update database
Update-Database
```

### 3. Run the App
Press **F5** or click **Start** in Visual Studio to launch the application.
Navigate to: `https://localhost:5001/` (or the HTTPS port shown in the output window)

### 4. Seed Users & Roles
If not automatically seeded (depends where `DataSeeder` is invoked‚Äîadd during startup if needed):

Default credentials (if seeded):
- Admin: `admin@insightly.com` / `Admin@123`
- Team Member: `member@insightly.com` / `Member@123`
- Client: `client@insightly.com` / `Client@123`


---
## üîê Security Notes
- Anti-forgery enforced on all form POSTs (`[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]`)
- Role-based trimming of project/task visibility (TeamMember & Client restricted)
- Consider adding authorization policies for finer-grained data scoping and ownership

---
## üõ£ Application Flow
1. User logs in (redirects based on role to respective dashboard)
2. Admin creates a Project, assigns Team Members / Clients
3. Admin creates Task Items, optionally assigns team members
4. Team Members view assigned tasks (filtered) and update status
5. Clients view their assigned projects & associated tasks (read-only)

---
## üß™ Testing (Recommended Next Steps)
- Add xUnit or MSTest project for controller & repository logic
- Use EF Core InMemory or SQLite for integration tests
- Mock `UserManager`/`SignInManager` for auth-related tests

---
## üì° API Summary
Core MVC endpoints are structured by controller/action convention. A concise reference is maintained in [API_DOCUMENTATION.md](./API_DOCUMENTATION.md). That file includes:
- Account (Register/Login/Logout/AccessDenied)
- Admin (User list, role assignment)
- Dashboards
- Projects (CRUD + Assign Team Members / Clients + search)
- TaskItems (CRUD + Status updates + team member JSON)

## üß± Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | ASP.NET Core 3.1 MVC |
| Auth | ASP.NET Core Identity + Roles |
| Data | Entity Framework Core (SQL Server / LocalDB) |
| UI | Razor Views, Bootstrap, jQuery |
| Real-time | (Planned: SignalR) |
| ORM Tooling | dotnet-ef migrations |

## ü§ù Contributions
For student/team collaboration: create feature branches, open PRs referencing roadmap items, ensure migrations are additive and named meaningfully.

## ‚úÖ At a Glance
- Secure, role-aware project/task platform
- Extensible data model with junction tables
